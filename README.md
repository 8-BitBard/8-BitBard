Hello there! Thanks for taking the time to check my GitHub out! 

The majority of the repositories listed here publicly are for my online portfolio, as a way of getting to know my code just a little bit better!
I code mostly in Python, and use my programming skills to help automate administration responsibilities, provide end user convenience, and help maintain organization security.

If you see anything you like, or have any questions for me, consider visiting the "Contact Me" section of my website!
